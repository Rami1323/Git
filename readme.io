Leverage Google Cloud’s AI-powered tools (Document AI, Vertex AI, AgentSpace, and NotebookLM) to automate and improve the analysis of legal and business contracts. The POC will validate how well these tools can:

Extract structured data from contract documents

Detect risks or anomalies in contract language

Enable multi-step AI-driven workflows

Support interactive exploration of contract contents

Desired Outcome:
To evaluate the capabilities, integration feasibility, and practical value of each tool (Document AI, Vertex AI, AgentSpace, NotebookLM) in the context of enterprise-level contract analysis — leading to recommendations for production implementation.
