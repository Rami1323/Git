Leverage Google Cloud’s AI-powered tools (Document AI, Vertex AI, AgentSpace, and NotebookLM) to automate and improve the analysis of legal and business contracts. The POC will validate how well these tools can:

Extract structured data from contract documents

Detect risks or anomalies in contract language

Enable multi-step AI-driven workflows

Support interactive exploration of contract contents

Desired Outcome:
To evaluate the capabilities, integration feasibility, and practical value of each tool (Document AI, Vertex AI, AgentSpace, NotebookLM) in the context of enterprise-level contract analysis — leading to recommendations for production implementation.



Successfully tested Vertex AI for contract risk scoring

Completed API integration and functional validation with AgentSpace

Document AI extraction workflows verified on sample contracts

NotebookLM API tested successfully for legal Q&A use cases

Final POC summary report and recommendation for production rollout


-------------------------

Scope:
This initiative focuses on implementing and enhancing Cloud Cost Optimization and FinOps practices across MTAI’s Azure and AWS environments. The goal is to reduce unnecessary cloud spending, improve the efficiency of resource usage, and ensure that cloud investments align with organizational priorities and budget targets.

Desired Outcome:

Realize annual cost savings of up to $1 million through proactive optimization measures

Establish a culture of ongoing cost accountability across teams and departments

Improve visibility into cloud usage and spending through transparent reporting and governance

Enable long-term cloud financial planning to support strategic decision-making and future scalability


----------------------------------------------------------

Achieved approximately $1 million in annual cloud cost savings through targeted optimizations, including hybrid licensing, virtual machine right-sizing, and automated resource shutdowns.

Successfully completed discovery and analysis to identify high-cost cloud resources and optimization opportunities.

Initiated organization-wide awareness and education efforts to promote FinOps best practices among key stakeholders and cloud consumers.

Established a dedicated FinOps function within the Center of Excellence to drive governance, accountability, and continuous cloud cost management.
