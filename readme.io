Leverage Google Cloud’s AI-powered tools (Document AI, Vertex AI, AgentSpace, and NotebookLM) to automate and improve the analysis of legal and business contracts. The POC will validate how well these tools can:

Extract structured data from contract documents

Detect risks or anomalies in contract language

Enable multi-step AI-driven workflows

Support interactive exploration of contract contents

Desired Outcome:
To evaluate the capabilities, integration feasibility, and practical value of each tool (Document AI, Vertex AI, AgentSpace, NotebookLM) in the context of enterprise-level contract analysis — leading to recommendations for production implementation.



Highlights
Currently testing out Vertex AI for contract risk scoring

API integration with AgentSpace is complete

Initial document extraction tests via Document AI are successful

Planning integration with NotebookLM for legal Q&A use cases
