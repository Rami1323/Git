Leverage Google Cloud’s AI-powered tools (Document AI, Vertex AI, AgentSpace, and NotebookLM) to automate and improve the analysis of legal and business contracts. The POC will validate how well these tools can:

Extract structured data from contract documents

Detect risks or anomalies in contract language

Enable multi-step AI-driven workflows

Support interactive exploration of contract contents

Desired Outcome:
To evaluate the capabilities, integration feasibility, and practical value of each tool (Document AI, Vertex AI, AgentSpace, NotebookLM) in the context of enterprise-level contract analysis — leading to recommendations for production implementation.



Successfully tested Vertex AI for contract risk scoring

Completed API integration and functional validation with AgentSpace

Document AI extraction workflows verified on sample contracts

NotebookLM API tested successfully for legal Q&A use cases
